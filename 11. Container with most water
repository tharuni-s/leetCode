Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {

        int l=0;
        int r=height.length-1;
        int max=0;
        while(l<r){
            int len=Math.min(height[l],height[r]);
            int width = r-l;
            max = Math.max(max,len*width);
            if(height[l]<height[r]){
                l++;
            }else{
                r--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

// firat compare first and last building..and find the amount of water we can able to store there
2. move on to next values to find the maximum values.
3. if left is less than right and then move left.. after continuously checking then we can able to find the maximum storage value
